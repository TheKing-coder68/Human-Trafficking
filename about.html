		<h1>Hello, my name is Generous.</h1>
		<p> I am a current sophomore at Laurel High School. I made this website because I felt the need to educate others about a horrible act that happens everyday-human trafficking. If you enjoyed and appreciated the information in the website, please share it with others. Together we can stop human trafficking for good.</p>
