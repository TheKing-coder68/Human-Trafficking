		<h2>What is Human Trafficking?</h2>
		<p> The Department of Homeland Security describes Human trafficking as: "the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act" In simple terms, human trafficking is when someone tricks another person to try to make that person do some type of labor- whether manual or sexual. </p>
