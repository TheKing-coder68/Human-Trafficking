		<h2>What is Human Trafficking?</h2>
		<p> The Department of Homeland Security describes Human trafficking as: "the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act" In simple terms, human trafficking is when someone tricks another person to try to make that person do some type of labor- whether manual or sexual. </p>

		<h2>Is It the Same as Human Smuggling?</h2>
		<p> Human trafficking is not the same as human smuggling. the U.S agency ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcements) describes human smuggling as the act of giving the "provision of a service—typically, transportation or fraudulent documents—to an individual who voluntarily seeks to gain illegal entry into a foreign country." So that means that human trafficking can start as human smuggling, but once the smuggler starts to use the smugglee for unpaid commercial or sexual labor,the crime is no longer only human smuggling, but also human trafficking. ICE is currently working to improve the U.S borders and make them more secure. </p>

		<h2>Why Don't It's Victims Leave?</h2>
		<p>One victim of human trafficking puts answers this question stating "It’s not because any one of us enjoys being hurt. It’s not because any one of us enjoys being raped or kidnapped. It’s because we do everything we can to survive, and there’s reasons why we make those decisions.” This is the mindset that millions of other victims have also. OURRescue- an organization made to help human trafficking victims- highlights three factors that could be holding back victims from leaving. Those factors are: Intimidation, Debt Bondage, and Isolation.</p>
		<h3> Intimidation</h3>
		<p> There could be possible threats to the victim or to the victims family if the victim tries to leave or tell the people, this is what happened in the case of the victim quoted earlier, her trafficker threaten to hurt her family if she didn't do what she was supposed to do.</p>
		<h3>Debt Bondage</h3>
		<p>Sometimes the trafficker uses debt bondage- saying that the victim most pay of all debt(whether real or not) before they can be freed. As a way to pay off that debt, the trafficker says that the victim must stay and keep working for them. This can leave the victim feeling trapped.</p>
  <h3>Isolation</h3>
	<p>Somtimes the victim is in a totally different country and can't speak the language that other people there speak, so they don't know how to approach anyone for help. The victim could also be scared of being deported or imprisoned. Befcause of all of these things, the victim could start to think that staying with their trafficker is their only source of protection.</p>
	<h3>Emotional Attachment</h3>
	<p> Some traffickers are so cruel that they try to develop in their victims, an emotional attrachment towards the trafficker. This could mean trying to make the victim build a sense of trust, love, and commitment towards the trafficker. Also of these points could make a victim stay with the trafficker.</p>
